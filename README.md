# Provisional Workflow for the Analysis of Antimicrobial Resistance-Associated Variants

This repository provides a step-by-step workflow for analyzing genetic variants associated with antimicrobial resistance. The pipeline is designed to process sequencing data and identify relevant variants in a systematic manner.

## Overview

The workflow consists of a series of scripts, each representing a different step in the analysis. The scripts should be run in the specified order to ensure accurate and consistent results. The pipeline is modular, allowing for easy updates and modifications as new tools or methods become available.
